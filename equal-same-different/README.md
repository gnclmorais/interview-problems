An integer X and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers are
given. We are interested in which elements of A are equal to X and which are
different from X. The goal is to split array A into two parts, such that the
number of elements equal to X in the first part is the same as the number of
elements different from X in the other part. More formally, we are looking for
an index K such that `0 ≤ K < N`, and the number of elements equal to X in
`A[0..K-1]` is the same as the number of elements different from X in
`A[K..N-1]`. (For K = 0, `A[0..K-1]` does not contain any elements.)
For example, given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
```
  A[0] = 5
  A[1] = 5
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 7
  A[4] = 2
  A[5] = 3
  A[6] = 5
```
K equals 4, because:
- two of the elements of `A[0..3]` are equal to X, namely `A[0] = A[1] = X`, and
- two of the elements of `A[4..6]` are different from X, namely A[4] and A[5].

Write a function:
```
function solution(X, A);
```
that, given an integer X and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of
N integers, returns the value of index K satisfying the above conditions.
If more than one index K satisfies the above conditions, your function may
return any of them. If there is no such index, the function should return -1.

For example, given integer X and array A as above, the function should return 4, as explained above.

Assume that:
- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
- X is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..100,000].

Complexity:
- expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
- expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage
  (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
